Welcome to Rails AI! This is a free, open source book that aims to make it as quick and easy as possible for you to build your Rails AI MVP. This book is itself an MVP, and at a very early stage. Thanks so much for being an early reader! {% .lead %}

## What's this book about?

From the start of the [ruby-openai](https://github.com) project in 2020, I always wanted to make it so that a junior developer could go to the correct section of the README, find a working example of the code they need, copy paste that exact code into their project and it would just work.

I believe that this experience is also valuable no matter how senior you are - documentation should be Simple, Clear, Up-to-date, Copy-Pasteable and Runnable.

ruby-openai has now been downloaded over 10 million times, and its documentation has proved to be widely and persistently popular and useful. For the past year I have been focusing on building Rails AI apps and MVPs for a wide variety of clients. In this book I'll share everything I've learned.

### Why is it free?

Like a lot of Rails developers, I learned to code using Michael Hartl's excellent [Rails Tutorial](https://www.railstutorial.org/). Back in 2013 this was free, and didn't even have an email signup wall. As a low-paid project manager trying to find my first dev role and struggling to pay rent in London, this tutorial was my lifeline; I worked on it every evening for 4 months until I landed my first junior Rails developer role. I want to try to recreate something like that experience for a new generation of builders.

### Is it finished?

No! I just started writing this book in May 2024. You can sign up for updates here, and follow along or even contribute on [Github](https://github.com/alexrudall/railsai)

### How do I get started?

Just [click here](/docs/setup) to get started.

## FAQ

### Can I just buy the code?

Yes! I sell the Rails AI codebase behind this book as well as a "Done For You" MVP building service via [https://landingburn.ai](https://landingburn.ai).

### Who are you?

I'm Alex! I've been a Rails engineer at major startups for over 10 years, building major production systems using Ruby on Railsâ„¢. I wrote and maintain the ruby-openai gem, which has been downloaded millions of times and is heavily used at multi-billion dollar businesses like Shopify and Gusto. I also maintain the Anthropic and Midjourney Ruby gems. My mission is to help you be successful building with Ruby and AI.

A long time ago I also wrote a sci-fi novel about AI eating the world - you can get it for Kindle [here](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Inkers-Alex-Rudall-ebook/dp/B00W8DLNSU) if you're into that kind of thing.

### Did AI write this book?

No - at least, not this version. For now I want to keep it hand-crafted by humans, as I believe that the effort that goes into a project makes a difference to how valuable it is.
