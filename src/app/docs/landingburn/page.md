## Build it for me

Just need it done, fast? I have limited availability for 1-week Rails AI MVP sprints, using the LandingBurn starter kit to save a huge amount of time.

More info [here](https://landingburn.ai) and a recent testimonial:

{% callout title="Testimonial - 1 week AI MVP, Dec 2023" %}
I cannot overstate what a great choice it was to recently work with Alex Rudall on a project. He was able to successfully integrate OpenAI functionality with a web application using Ruby on Rails and the ruby-openai gem that he personally authored.

His understanding and thoughtfulness to create the MVP was remarkable. His intuition allowed him to quickly grasp the issues involved in a healthcare setting and the many nuances associated with collecting healthcare information from various sources... In the end, he had successfully developed an MVP which we will incorporate into our operations and continue to use.

More importantly, I was pleasantly surprised that he could develop such high quality, well documented, and clear code in such a short period of time. He really surprised me with an MVP ahead of schedule.

Hands down, this is the most ethical, efficient, and productive developer I have ever worked with (and there are many!). Alex is a total pleasure to work with, and we will continue to work with him in the future.

## Just give me the code

The code in this book and a lot more comes from LandingBurn, the Rails AI starter kit. If you don't have time to implement it yourself, you can buy the starter kit [here](https://landingburn.ai), fully licensed for client or startup work, and get started immediately!
